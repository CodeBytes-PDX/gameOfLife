###### Game of Life code

* `gol-1.rb` is an object-oriented take, including my own tweaks to code
  develped with Nick App and Nader Mortazavi. The extremely basic output
  correctly indicates that `0,0` is a neighbor with `0,1` but not `5,5`.

* `gol-2.rb` is a functional implementation with more output: first, the
  10x10 grid is displayed, and then each cell's status is displayed along
  with neighbor counts and what should happen to it based on the four rules.

* `gol-3.py` is essentially the same as `gol-2.rb`, but implemented in python.
